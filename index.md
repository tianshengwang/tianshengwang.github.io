Assistant Professor (from Sep 1, 2025) · Dept. of Pharmaceutical Health Outcomes & Policy (PHOP) · University of Houston College of Pharmacy

## Research Focus

I develop and apply **AI-powered causal inference** methods to assess drug effects in real‑world data. Current themes:

* **Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE) assessment:** heterogeneous causal effects assessment and subgroup identification in real-world data.
* **Confounding Control:** Longitudinal patterns (e.g., thdPS) of features for confounding control (collaborative project with [Dr. Til Stürmer](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/til-sturmer-md-phd/) @ UNC).
* **Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD):** assess causal effects of drug repurposing candidates on dementia.
