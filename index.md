## Research Focus

I develop and apply **AI-powered causal inference** methods to assess drug effects in real‑world data. Current themes:

* **Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE):** Iterative Causal Forest (iCF) and **High‑dimensional iCF (hdiCF)** for subgroup identification.
* **Confounding Control:** Longitudinal patterns (e.g., thdPS) for confounding control (collaborative project with [Dr. Til Stürmer](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/til-sturmer-md-phd/) @ UNC).
* **Drug repurposing for dementia:** Claims‑based algorithms for **dementia** identification and drug repurposing pipelines.
